This is an app 'grown' between 15.09.2016 & 17.11.2016

while working with IFMO web technologies master program

we gradually studied routing, templating, middleware

On 17.11.2016 I demoed the express-chat socket.io sample

and suggested the students make the 'live' userlist in the same way

Two of them did that very quickly ({Mark, Dima})

======

So what? If seen as a step for further development we could

a) make the add/remove routes middleware-protected

b) import express sessions to do it better

c) gracefully pass to Mongo replacing simple json solution

d) provide frontend (make handlebars for forms)

e) think of a SPA thick client side

f) develop sign up procedure along with captcha and emailing

g) develop passport authentication

h) make it MVC-good-looking, maybe like megaboilerplate

======

So, although technology is suffering, there is or might be more to do to feel more 'mature'
